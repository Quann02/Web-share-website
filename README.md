## Additional Information Added
- I included the website’s favicon in the preview if available. This is retrieved from the `<link rel="icon">` tag in the webpage's HTML.

### Example URL
- Use the following URL to see the favicon included: [https://www.bbc.com](https://www.bbc.com).

## Visual Style Improvements
- I added a subtle box-shadow and rounded corners to the preview box to enhance visual appeal.
- Included the favicon icon next to the title for a quick visual reference to the website’s branding.
- Improved text readability with consistent font sizes and color choices.
